  SLEEPING DOGS ONE HIT KNOCK OUT
</h1>

This mod for the game Sleeping Dogs makes your character die in one hit as the name says.

I have tested it fairly a lot and I think it should work. If you however do end up having any problems, don't be shy and share them, and in-case you know the answer said problem, why not pull request a fix?

## Installation

- Download the latest version under the releases section.
- Then simply extract the .DLL and drop it in your games folder.

## Make your own version

1. You should be able to either press the green button saying "Code" and press Download ZIP. Obviously a different way if you have your own.
2. After that you normally extract the files and voil√†! You have successfully cloned the project.
3. Open the .sln file using Visual Studio (Latest recommended).
4. Once you have made your changes and are ready to test, then just simply go to "Build" on top of the window and either click "Build Source" or "Build Solution". Both options are completely same, unless you have changed them yourself, which I assume you know the difference if you do.
5. If the build was successfull, then in the location where your .sln file is, you now have a new folder called "Compiled". Open it, then folder "Files" and there's your .DLL, which you can now put into your games folder!
